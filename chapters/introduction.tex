% The importance of software parallelization
\quad Parallelism has become pervasive in the world of computing, with parallel hardware omnipresent across the whole spectrum of various computing systems from low-end embedded processors to high-end supercomputers. Yet, most of the existing software is written in a sequential fashion: be it an old legacy software initially designed to run on the available at that time serial hardware or modern applications being developed by application domain experts rather than performance engineers. In order to exploit all available hardware facilities software has to be parallelized.
% Challenges in the field
\begin{description}[style=unboxed,leftmargin=0cm]
\item[Manual parallelization] The task of software parallelization has characteristically been a very manual process, which is multifaceted, extremely complex, time consuming and error-prone. An embarrassingly parallel problem might end up being hidden behind a thoughtless software design, a serial algorithm or being implemented with an unsuccessfully chosen lover level constructs, such as pointers, heap-allocated and pointer-linked data structures, indirect array referencing, etc. To elegantly and effectively map a parallel problem onto the exact hardware a programmer must work on the various abstract levels and possess an expert-level knowledge in the range of various fields from software design and algorithmic patterns in software engineering down to compiler's automatic vectorization and hardware cache coherence protocols. It is not always realistic to expect such a deep expertise from an average programmer. Done in the wrong way software parallelization can even slow the program down in comparison to its original sequential version. 
\item[Automatic parallelization] Despite decades of intensive research in automatic software parallelization~\cite{6813266}, fully exploiting the potential of modern multi- and many-core hardware still requires a significant manual effort. Furthermore, the automatic parallelization techniques are limited to narrow domains of scientific Fortran codes and relatively simple computational idioms.
\item[ML based parallelization] There has been a wide research into utilizing more exotic to the field of software parallelization machine learning based methods. A good overview is provided by \cite{ml-oboyle}. Although these methods have proved to be extremely useful and high performing on some compilation technology problems like selecting the best compiler flags or finding the most optimal compiler optimization parameters (like loop unroll or function inline factors). Due to the inherent statistical errors and unavailability of large training data sets these methods have not yet found a widespread application in the area of software parallelization. 
\end{description}
% The solution
We have done a thorough literature review and understand the background. In our project we are not trying to find a "silver bullet" and solve the problem of automatic parallelization. Neither do we try to tune a machine learning algorithms to a 100\% perfect prediction accuracy. Given the difficulty of the obstacles faced by the field today, we do not expect that programmers will be liberated from performing manual parallelization in the near future~\cite{Larsen:2012:PML:2410141.2410600}. Instead, we acknowledge the role of a human programmer in the software parallelization process, but we do not expect the programmer to be an expert. All we try to do is to reduce the manual effort by providing a programmer with a parallelization \textit{assistant solution}. Our solution alleviates the task and makes it more accessible for an average programmer. The assistant solution we propose is as multifaceted as the problem itself. To fully exploit all the potential of software parallelization a programmer has to work on several conceptual levels. Thus, the assistant solution consists of a tool and a library aiming at different stages of software parallelization process. 

\section{Loop parallelization assistant}
\label{introduction_assistant}

% problem: the need for manual parallelization, auto-parallelisation does not deliver desired performance improvements

\quad Despite decades of intensive research in automatic software
parallelization~\cite{6813266}, fully exploiting the potential of modern multi- and many-core hardware still requires a significant manual effort.

% solution: parallelisation assistant

Chapter \ref{assistant} introduces a novel parallelization assistant tool that aids a programmer in the process of parallelizing a program in the frequent case where automatic approaches fail to do so. The assistant works at the finer levels of granularity, namely the program loops. Loops are compelling candidates for parallelization, as they are naturally decomposable and tend to capture most of the execution time in a program.
%
The assistant reduces the manual effort in this process by presenting a programmer with a ranking of program loops that are most likely to 1) require little or no effort for successful parallelization and 2) improve the program's performance when parallelized.
%
Thus, it improves over the traditional, profile-guided process by also taking into account the \emph{probability} of potential parallelization for each of the profiled loops.

% how?

At the core of our parallelization assistant resides a novel machine-learning (ML) model of loop parallelizability.
%
Focusing on loops allows the model to leverage a large amount of specific analyses available in modern compilers, such as generalized iterator recognition~\cite{Manilov:2018:GPI:3178372.3179511} and loop dependence analysis~\cite{Jensen:2017:ILD:3132652.3095754}.
%
The model encodes the results of these analyses together with basic properties of the loops as machine learning \textit{features}.
%
The loop parallelizability model is trained, validated, and tested on 1415 loops
from the SNU NAS Parallel Benchmarks (SNU
NPB)~\cite{Seo:2011:PCN:2357490.2358063}.
%
The loops are labelled using a combination of expert OpenMP~\cite{Dagum:1998:OIA:615255.615542}
annotations and optimization reports from the Intel \cpp{} Compiler (ICC), a
production-quality parallelizing compiler.
%
The model is evaluated on multiple machine learning algorithms.
%
The evaluation shows that -- despite the limited size of the data set -- our model achieves a prediction accuracy higher than 90\%.
%
\quad The parallelization assistant combines inference on the parallelizability model
with traditional profiling to rank higher those loops with a high probability of being parallelizable and impacting the program performance.
%
An evaluation on eight programs from the SNU NPB suite shows that
the program performance tends to improve faster as loops are parallelized in the ranking order suggested by our parallelization assistant compared to a traditional order based on profiling only.
%
On average, following the order suggested by the assistant reduces by approximately 20\% the number of lines of code a programmer has to examine manually to parallelize SNU NPB to its expert-level speedup.
%
Given the high level of effort involved in manual analysis, such a reduction
can translate into substantial development cost savings.

\end{itemize}

\section{Computational frameworks library}
\label{introduction_frameworks}
\quad As we have already stated the problem of software parallelization is multifaceted. In order to arrive at the final solution a programmer has to work on multiple conceptual levels starting from problem decomposition and algorithm choice down to software architecture design, data structure choice and finer grained low level loop optimizations. Our solution reduces the programmer's efforts along this curved and iterative path. If our loop parallelization assistant aims at reducing programmer's efforts at the finest granularity level, the library of computational frameworks alleviates the tasks of software architecture design, as well as algorithm and data structure choice. The central motivating ground for the concept of computational frameworks and the prototype library we propose is formed by the data-centric parallelization (DCP) problem, limitations of the background work tackling the problem and the properties of the real world legacy code.

\item[Data-centric parallelization problem] Among all lower level implementation questions, the problem of successful data structure choice stands particularly prominent and important. Listings \ref{lst:introduction_array} and \ref{lst:introduction_list} illustrate how easily the parallelization can be hampered.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Parallelisable loop operating on a \textbf{linear array}.},label={lst:introduction_array},language=C]

  a[i]=a[i]+1;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

  p->value+=1;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
If a programmer had a tool, that could automatically recognize the type and properties of the data structure and even automatically substitute it with a simpler, parallelizable and more suitable alternative data structure, it would make the parallelization process a lot easier. Unfortunately, as our background research discovered the solution to the problem is not available at the moment. There are a lot of various techniques and methodologies, but they all have their limitations and problems.
\item[Background work] The idea of discovery of higher level entities in programs is definitely not a novel one. Shape analysis is one of the most well-known techniques, which aims at understanding of various heap-allocated data structures and their properties at compile time \cite{Sagiv:1999:PSA:292540.292552},\cite{Wilhelm:2000:SA:647476.760384}, \cite{Ghiya:1996:TDC:237721.237724}). These techniques maintain a certain mathematical model (a graph or a set of matrices) at some program points and are based on abstract interpretation methods. On being interpreted the program statements update the model and finally lead to an approximation of the sought problem answer (node reachability, data structure cyclicity, disjointedness, etc.). \textit{Shape analysis techniques give a rough and conservative approximation (a \textit{Tree} (be it a binary tree or a linked-list) and work with high error rates (\textit{DAGs} vs. \textit{Cycles}), as well as are provably undecidable.} One of the more recent techniques is based on the pattern matching on the code intermediate representation (IR) level. The main idea is to specify computational idioms (such as reductions, stencils, sparse and dense linear algebra computations, etc.) to be recognized in a domain specific constraint based programming language CAnDL \cite{Ginsbach:2018:CDS:3178372.3179515},\cite{Ginsbach:2017:DEG:3049832.3049862}, \cite{Ginsbach:2018:AML:3296957.3173182},\cite{Ginsbach:2018:AML:3296957.3173182}. \textit{The CAnDL language allows for a rapid prototyping of new compiler optimisations based on pattern recognition and its substitution with an optimised versions of matched idioms, but it is limited for a relatively simple computational idioms and entities.} 
\quad All the above methods are static and limited in their program view to a single compilation unit. The task of recognizing data structures is a grand challenge requiring a much broader view. Of all the available techniques only dynamic analysis techniques can come the closest to the solution of the DCP problem. There are numerous works available \cite{Rupprecht:2017:DID:3155562.3155607}\cite{Haller:2016:SDS:2938006.2938029}, \cite{Haller:2016:SDS:2938006.2938029}, \cite{Rupprecht:2017:DID:3155562.3155607}. These techniques are based on program instrumentation and construction of various dynamic memory allocation graphs. The idea is that these graphs along with their update operations can reflect the actual shape of the data structure. Probably the most promising and the best performing of all is the work of a Data-structure Detection Tool (DDT) \cite{1669122}. The technique has been deployed to recognise data structure implementations withing standard libraries like STL, Apache (STDCXX), Borland (STLport), GLib, Trimaran achieving almost perfect recognition accuracy. Moreover, the technique has been able to recognise linked lists in Em3d and Bh Olden benchmarks, along with red-black trees implementing vectors in Xalancbmk benchmark. But it is still far from an automatic data structure technique, that could be used in a production quality compiler and tackling a wide set of various benchmakrs and programs.
\item[Real world code complexity level] The simple motivating example behind the DCP problem is obviously far below the complexity level of the real world code. The work with data structure can be spread all around the code base: allocation and initialization happens in one translation unit, update operations on the data structure are scattered between various functions in multiple other translation units. The exact way an operation works determines the properties (cyclicity, reachability, etc.) of a data structure and untimately its type. It is crucial to understand how an algorithm actually calls data structure update operations. \textit{Thus, all that leads to the inseparability of algorithms and data structures: understanding the data structure type might require the understanding of the algorithm and vise versa. If one aims at data structure substitution, one might need to transform the algorithm as well.} Indeed, as our feasibility studies of SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite have shown let alone automatic techniques, it might take some weeks even for an experienced human software engineer to understand what kind of data structures a benchmark uses and how to optimize it.
\end{description}
\quad The task of separating data structures and algorithms seems infeasible. Moreover, for some applications and benchmarks it does not seem meaningful either. For example, the suite of Olden benchmarks is much simpler, than SPEC CPU2006, but also confirms the fact of inseparability. For many of Olden benchmarks the data structures and algorithms form the union, but we can parallelize and rewrite the suite with a higher level entities, which embody both data structures and algorithms. In our project we propose the novel notion of \textit{computational frameworks}. The latter help a programmer with a coarse-grained parallelization tasks, such as software design, algorithm and data structure choice. We provide a prototype off-the-shelf C++ template library implementing the notion. The latter are ready to use parallelism patterns. A programmer only needs to customize his computation through an LLVM-like interface. We prototyped the library on the suite of Olden benchmarks. The parallel library version is consistently outperforming the sequential version hitting 5-6x speedups on the major benchmarks.\newline\null
