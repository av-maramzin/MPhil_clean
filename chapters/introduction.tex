\chapter{Introduction}
\quad Parallel computing and software parallelization are the vast overlapping and complementary computer science areas with a history dating back to 1950s. With the advances in semiconductor industry the topics have left from high-end scientific supercomputers niche and spread to a much wider area spanning to all consumer electronic devices and are of major importance now. The parallelism is pervasive and all. Every computer scientist, software developer would benefit from having an insight into the area. Nonetheless the topics are extremely difficult and require a great deal of knowledge in various subtopics. Not all
