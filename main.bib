  abstract  = "In the last decade, machine-learning-based compilation has moved from an obscure research niche to a mainstream activity. In this paper, we describe the relationship between machine learning and compiler optimization and introduce the main concepts of features, models, training, and deployment. We then provide a comprehensive survey and provide a road map for the wide variety of different research areas. We conclude with a discussion on open issues in the area and potential research directions. This paper provides both an accessible introduction to the fast moving area of machine-learning-based compilation and a detailed bibliography of its main achievements.",
