\abstract{%
\quad In the modern world parallel hardware has become ubiquitous through the entire spectrum of computing systems from low-end embedded devices to high-end supercomputers. Yet and still, most of the existing software is written in a sequential fashion: be it an old legacy software initially designed to run on the available at that time serial hardware or modern applications being developed by application domain experts rather than performance engineers. In order to exploit all available hardware facilities software has to be parallelized.\newline\null
\quad The problem of software parallelization is multifaceted and requires of programmers to possess an additional (apart from their application domain expertise) knowledge in various domains of parallel programming (from cache coherence protocols to high level algorithmic skeletons). The task of software parallelization is a challenging one. Done in the wrong way software parallelization can even slow the program down in comparison to its original sequential version. For decades researches and engineers have been working on alleviating the challenging task of software parallelization. One of these work directions is automatic parallelization techniques, which are supposed to ultimately liberate programmers from the challenging task of manual parallelization. But, despite the massive body of work on the subject, automatic techniques still cannot deliver performance levels expert programmers reach and are limited to narrow domains of scientific Fortran codes and relatively simple computational idioms.\newline\null
\quad Given the difficulty of the obstacles faced by automatic parallelisation today, we do not expect a breakthrough in the area or a "silver bullet" solving the problem in the near future. We acknowledge the role of a human expert, but at the same time we propose an assistant solution, which can be used to guide programmer's efforts and alleviate the manual parallelisation task.\newline\null
\quad The assistant solution we propose is as multifaceted as the problem itself and consists of several components aimed to tackle different aspects of software parallelisability. It is a toolkit rather than a single tool. The first tool in the toolkit has been designed, developed and assessed during the first year of my PhD. Complementary tools are supposed to be developed over the course of remaining time.\newline\null
\quad The designed tool is basically a machine learning (ML) based model of loop parallelisability integrated and utilised into an assistant scheme. Assistant takes an application to be parallelised along with its profile as an input and presents a programmer with a ranking of application loops. In contrast to a profile guided approach, assistant's ranking highlights application loops, which are not only long-running (and thus potentially profitable), but crucially parallelisable. This way a programmer concentrates his efforts on promising application loops and converges to the best achievable performance faster. We have deployed our assistant on SNU NAS Parallel Benchmarks \cite{snu-npb-benchmarks} \cite{nasa-parallel-benchmarks} and demonstrated a potential of our idea \cite{aiseps}.\newline\null
\quad The second tool we want to add to our software parallelisation toolkit solution is aimed at addressing the problem of unsuccessful data structure choice, which might turn a perfectly parallelisable at a higher level computation into a non-parallelisable lower level implementation. The tool is at the literature review and feasibility study stage.
